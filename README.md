New year, new AoC 😎

Hopefully I can complete more days, and get more stars than last year 😁🤞.

Doing the best I could after day 25 I got a total of 42 stars which I am very proud of. This is my 3rd year doing Aoc, my first year I got 24 stars, and last year I got 33. Day 16 was the only day where I didn't get any stars, and I think I could have solved it if I spent a little more time on it. I will still try to solve it within the next couple of days. Overall, it was a good year of Aoc 👍.
